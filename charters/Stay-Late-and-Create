#SLAC: Stay Late and Create
*Last modified 2015-05-30*

##Purpose
The goal of SLAC is to provide an open venue with resources, empowerment, and support for peer learning and personal projects.

##Membership
SLAC is a very open club with all members invited to organize small seminars or courses and to participate in organizational measures.

##Officers and Roles
SLAC is shaped around a loose organizational structure relying on the volunteerism and goodwill of general members and event attendees to keep events happening and sustainable, under the leadership of the SLAC President. The SLAC President is in charge of the mailing list, has the final say on decisions, and may appoint members to be on point for logistical issues like purchases, event organization, or advertisement. 

##Transition Protocol
Prior to graduation, any member in control of credentials for services utilized or worked on by the various projects within SLAC will transfer ownership of said credentials to non-graduating members.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
SLAC provides snacks and drinks during weekly meetings and occasionally will purchase equipment for use on club projects and peer-led seminars. Most SLAC-sponsored events will be held in the library. Additional purchases will be made for the annual SLAC Hackathon, SLACFest.

##Events and Activities
We meet weekly to provide a venue for personal project work, peer-led seminars or training, as well as discussions and open-ended explorations of new technological areas. In addition to weekly meetings, SLAC also hosts an annual ‘hackathon’ for Babson, Olin, and Wellesley students. The final area of focus for  SLAC is the goal of working with other clubs and organizations to help put on events. 

##Amendment Procedure
The charter can be changed at any time with a reasonable consensus of active members.
