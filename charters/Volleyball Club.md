#Volleyball Club
*Last modified 2015-05-01*

##Purpose
The goal of volleyball club is to join people through an enjoyable sport and expand sports at Olin and spread a passion for volleyball.

##Membership
Everyone on the mailing list is a member and can participate as often or as little as they want.

##Officers and Roles
One person in charge of mailing list, this person is also the "coach" who organizes practices and is in charge of keeping track of equipment, the "coach" can appoint an "assistant coach" to help out with organization and to fill in responsibilities when the "coach" is not available.

##Transition Protocol
When the "coach" can no longer fill their responsibilities, the "assistant coach" will take on the responsibilities of "coach", maintaining the spirit of the club. The "coach's" last job will be to inform the head of clubs and activities of the change.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The club needs multiple volleyballs which are stored in a bag in the ball room, anyone can use these balls as long as they put them back or report damage or loss. Ideally we would also like to purchase a volleyball net that can be set up for the first few months of fall so we do not have to go to Babson and can practice outside.

##Events and Activities
We will host practices bi-weekly based on what works best for everyone. We will use these practices as a way to form a team and participate in Babson tournaments. The club will also throw volleyball scrimmages for fun if we can get a net, and put it up for outside events.

##Amendment Procedure
Amendments can be made at any time if 50% of members agree or the "coach" puts in a sway vote.
