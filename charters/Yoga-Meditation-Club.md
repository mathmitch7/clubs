#Yoga/Meditation Group
*Last ammended: 2014-09-07*

##Purpose
To provide people with two main things: a set of tools they can use to practice yoga and meditation on their own or in a group for the maintenance of mental and physical health and as a stress reliever, as well as a group in which to practice said things. In addition to these, the group will serve to spread the awareness of the benefits of yoga and meditation.

##Membership
Members of this group are free to come and go to sessions as they please, and there is no commitment required, though regular attendance can prove to be beneficial for the group and the group member. While at sessions, the Group Guide can ask a member to leave if they are disorderly or disrespectful after several warnings. Members are also welcome to contribute to sessions via suggestions or by taking leadership for certain exercises.

##Officers and Roles
* Group Guide (2): These will be the members of the group who will help lead certain exercises and meditation sessions by guiding the group though postures, positions, etc. In the event of absence of a Group Guide, any confident, experienced member can step up and take on this role.

##Transition Protocol
The main Group Guides can choose the next Group Guides for the next year at the end of the current year, around the time of April. The new guides must notify SAC of the change.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
This group currently requires nothing more than Yoga mats, which group members may purchase themselves, or they can have it provided to them. These yoga mats will be free to use by all students, except during the time at which the sessions are happening. The mats must be returned promptly. They will be stored in the West Hall gym.

##Events and Activities
We will hold weekly to bi monthly meet-ups / sessions which can occur at anytime. When a Group Guide calls a meeting, anyone is welcome to join them. Any member may also call a meeting. One annual event we will hold is a Yogathon, where it will be a half day event in which we do Yoga and meditation for a long time. We will hold these meet-ups and sessions either outdoors or unoccupied spaces such as classrooms in the AC or the library (especially for meditation).

##Amendment Procedure
Amending this Charter can happen through contacting and talking to an appointed Group Guide. Any member may propose an amendment, and the Group Guides must agree for the change to go through. Seeing as this club is fairly open, it will be known that changes can occur without too much officialism.
