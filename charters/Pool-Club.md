*Last modified 2015-05-18*

## Purpose

To maintain the pool hall and promote proper usage through collaboration with CORe and other pool-related clubs, such as Crud Club.

## Membership

Everyone who plays pool!  The mailing list will be used to spread the word about and solicit help for repair activities.

## Officers and Roles

The President is in charge of setting up club events, communication, acquiring food, and storing valuable equipment in the Pool Club chest.

## Transition Protocol

The President will find a successor each Spring, unless they will be returning the following Fall.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

The Club owns a chest in the Pool Hall in which it stores repair and replacement supplies.  The President has access to the chest, which is locked to safeguard its contents.  The speakers in the Pool Hall also belong to Pool Club.  The tables, wall and lighting fixtures, paint, and chairs are maintained by facilities or CORe.  Food may be purchased for tournaments or repair parties.

## Events and Activities

There may or may not be pool tournaments.  There has been little past interest, but the option is always open if members would like to help organize a tournament.  Repair parties will definitely happen, and food will probably be supplied.

## Amendment Procedure

Amendments may be proposed to the President, who has final say in amending the charter.
