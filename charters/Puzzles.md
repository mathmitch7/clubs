##Membership
Anyone is free to join. We will meet once a week, hopefully in room 126.

##Officers and Roles
The quizmaster is the leader of the puzzles club. The quizmaster manages the mailing list, has the final say on club decisions and may appoint a cabinet or subcommittee to help with logistical issues such as purchases or advertisement as he or she sees fit.

##Transition Protocol
In the month of April, the quizmaster must designate a successor, who will take over immediately until the end of the next school year. At that time, the new quizmaster will inform the Director of Clubs and Organizations that the transition has occurred.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We will buying puzzles occasionally throughout the year for student use. We will request money for these items.

##Events and Activities
We will be meeting every week to do puzzles and occasionally go to puzzling events in the area. 

##Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the Director of Clubs and Organizations.
