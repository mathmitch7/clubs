#Pokémon Club
*Last modified 2016-08-28*

## PokéNames
The official name of the club is "the Franklin W. Olin Pokémon League". Alternative names include "Olin Pokémon Club", "Pokémon Club", "Olin Pokémon", and "Franklin W. Olin League". These names are mostly interchangable and can be used for clarity's sake when communicating about club business.

## PokéAccents
The club maintains that the proper pronounciation of "Pokémon" is "poh-kay-mohn." As such, members and officers should try to use an e with an accute accent (like this one: é) whenever they write the word "Pokémon" or use the shortening of it: "Poké". However, everybody makes mistéks, so there's no penalty for messing this up or saying "poh-kih-mohn" or "poh-kee-mohn" out loud. It's more of a guideline than an actual rule.

## PokéPurpose
To celebrate and play Pokémon in all its forms.

## PokéMembership
Members are anybody on the [PokéMailingList](https://lists.olin.edu/mailman/listinfo/pokemon). Members don't have any particular obligations. They also don't have to be Olin students.

## PokéOfficers
The Pokémon Professor serves as the person in charge of the club and is "considered an expert in their respective region." They have whatever powers they need to do Pokéthings. They can appoint other PokéPositions or even grant PokéTitles as they wish. 

## PokéTransitions
If the Pokémon Professor can no longer serve in their role, they will appoint a successor in a manner of their choosing. You know, a PokéSuccessor.

## PokéMaterials, PokéPurchases and PokéSpaces
The club generally doesn't have materials that it personally owns. However, if it decides to make a PokéPurchase, those materials will go in a publically accessible PokéSpace and the PokéMembership will be informed.

## PokéEvents and PokéActivities
The Pokémon Professor can organize PokéEvents for the club whenever they want. These activities can include, but are not limited to, release events, Pokémon Movie or anime viewings, Pokémon Tournaments (either of videogames or the trading card game), and Pokémon Go walks. They should ask the members what kind of events they want at least once a semester, and try to make them happen.

## PokéSeal
No, not a Spheal. The club has an official seal, or PokéSeal, that is to be used in advertisements for the club. The PokéSeal can be found at P:\+ClubsOrgs\Pokemon, hopefully in perpetuity. It consists of Poké Ball in the center with silhouettes of the Academic Center, Campus Center, and Milas Hall around the central button. Above the Poké Ball are the words "Franklin W. Olin League" and below it are the words "Est. 2013".

## PokéAmendments
Amendments to the charter can be proposed to or by the Pokémon Professor at any time. They ultimately have to be approved by the Pokémon Professor.
