*Last modified 2016-08-28*

## Purpose
Olinomic is Olin's offical game of nomic. Generally speaking, the players try to change the rules of olinomic and win, roughly in that order.

## Rules
The rules will be located, for the foreseeable future, at [the olinomic repo](https://github.com/olin/olinomic/blob/master/rules.md).

## Membership
Membership is whatever the rules currently define the membership to be.

## Officers and Roles
There probably exist officers or people with particular roles; they are whatever the rules currently define the officers to be. 

## Transition Protocol
The game exists for as long as the rules say the game exists. It's also run by whoever the rules say it's run by. The rules should detail a transition protocol, but they might not. Such an issue should be brought up with players as a suggestion for a rule-change.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space
The game might have materials, purchases, or spaces. They will be detailed in the rules, or at least, known by the officers.

## Events and Activities
The primary activity of olinomic is playing olinomic according to the rules. The rules may detail other activities or events.

## Amendment Procedure
The rules are amended by a process detailed by the rules. This document can be amended as needed by whoever says it needs to be amended. This document can't supercede the rules of olinomic for the purposes of playing olinomic. Functional ammendments to the playing of olinomic should be proposed to the players of olinomic in a way consistent with the rules.
