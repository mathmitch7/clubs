Skate Club
*Last modified 2015-06-01*

##Purpose 
Skate Club is intended to be a community for those who skate, whether that be skateboarding or longboarding. The club intends to help beginners learn to ride by providing them with mentors, friends, and equipment as well as connecting existing skateboarders and longboarders with others in the community with similar interests in skateboarding and/or longboarding.

##Membership 
Membership is intended to be relaxed, allowing members to participate, or not, as they see fit while hopefully keeping some regular members around to facilitate events and manage equipment.

##Officers and Roles
The role of the "Board" entails maintaining activity on the mailing list as well as being the main contact(s) for all events, equipment, and interested students.

##Transition Protocol
By April of each year, graduating members of the "Board" must ensure they have successors to fill whatever role they served. While the number of people on the Board is not strict, all responsibilities (including maintenance of equipment, the mailing list, and club activity) should be accounted for.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
As of Fall 2014, club storage is a nook in the EH1 lounge closet. This houses boards, hardware, and even building materials. Anyone is allowed to use the boards and hardware as long as they have received approval from the "Board" ahead of time. Building equipment is reserved for those who have received training and approval from the "Board".

##Events and Activities
Throughout the semester, we hope to host several "ride days" to organize Oliners in a longboarding/riding kickout of sorts. Other than those organized days, any member is free to use the mailing list to put together rides, movies, or any other club-related event.

##Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time. If an amendment receives a vote of support from at least 50% of the membership, it passes and the revised charter will be sent to the SAC Clubs and Organizations Chair. If less than 50% of the membership responds to the amendment, the decision will be left to the discretion of the Board.
