# Olin Rock Orchestra
*Last modified 2015-05-19*

## Purpose

To create evocative and compelling art by bring together the usually-disparate worlds of classical and rock instruments.

## Membership

Members must attend our rehearsals every Friday evening, and as we get closer to concert, we will schedule more ad-hoc rehearsals to fit people's schedules. The night of the concert should be assumed to be a full day of prep.

## Officers and Roles

The King or Queen of Rock is in charge of auditioning new members, setting up the logistics of concerts, making sure we have music to play, and running rehearsals. S/He is strongly encouraged to delegate some of these responsibilities as s/he sees fit.

## Transition Protocol

Over the course of the spring semester, the King/Queen of Rock must designate a successor (or him/herself) to carry on his/her duties in the new year. S/he can then spend the last few months grooming his/her successor so that things run smoothly in the new year.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

Most of our purchases will be pickups and audio equipment. We may also occasionally purchase an instrument; for example, we have purchased some cymbals to go with the SAC drum kit, as well as a high-end synthesizer. We also sometimes have to purchase software to enable us to arrange our own music. Rehearsals are typically in the Jam Room, and performances are typically at Sorenson Theater.

## Events and Activities

We have rehearsals every week, and performances once or twice per semester.

## Amendment Procedure

The King or Queen of Rock can change this charter at any time.
