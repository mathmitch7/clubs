# Olin Performance Improv Und Magick
*Last modified 2015-06-02*

## Purpose

To learn and practice long- and short-form imrpov comedy; to do improv performances at Olin; to travel to improv jams with other college troupes, compete, and seek out coaching and demonstrations from professional comedians

## Membership

Auditions are held at the beginning of each academic year and somewhere from 6-10 troupe members are chosen. Troupe members commit to one 2-hour practice per week along with an optional 1-hour extra practice. OPIUM will hold open workshops for any Olin students to attend once every month or two.

## Officers and Roles

OPIUM has two co-leaders who run practice, investigate opportunities and organize logistics for travel/growth, and plan/advertise shows.

## Transition Protocol

If one of the two co-leaders is graduating, the troupe votes in April for a replacement. The younger of the co-leaders traditionally leads most practices and steps up organizationally under the guidance of the elder co-leader so that they can learn the ropes.

## Club Materials, Purchases and Space

The club needs no materials, but may submit requests to fund competition entry fees or to subsidize Oliners' tickets should they attend these shows (ie, ComedyFest in Boston last year charged something like $12 to watch a round).

## Events and Activities

Shows, workshops, hosting other improv troupes, traveling to jam with other improv troupes, going into Boston to watch adults do improv

## Amendment Procedure

Amendments to this charter can be proposed at any time by any member. We will talk it over and get communal agreement on a change; if there is division, we'll take a vote and pass the amendment if there's greater than 50% approval.
