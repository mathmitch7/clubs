##Purpose

##Membership
Everyone who shows up!  There's a mailing list for primary event info broadcasting, and some special events will be carpe'd.

##Officers and Roles
The President is in charge of setting up club events, communication, acquiring food, and ensuring jocularity.

##Transition Protocol
The President will find a successor each Spring, unless they will be returning the following Fall.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We won't have any permanent possessions, but each club meeting will have food to promote attendance and club unity.  Club meetings will be held in suite lounges or floor lounges, determined on a meeting-by-meeting basis.

##Events and Activities
Events will consist solely of watching and discussing each week's episodes, probably on Friday evenings, although best dates will be determined based on member preference.  Food choices will also be determined by member preference.

##Amendment Procedure
Amendments may be proposed to the President, who has final say in amending the charter.

##Other
We Love Cheesy Poofs!
